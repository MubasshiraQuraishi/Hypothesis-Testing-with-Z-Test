📊 **Learning never stops!**

I’ve been diving into **Z-tests**, an important concept in **hypothesis testing** used to make inferences about population **proportions** and **means**.

To make things easier for myself, I first created a **summary table** on my own to break down the different types of Z-tests and understand when to use each one. That hands-on approach really helped!

Then, I implemented what I learned using **Python** on the **Student Performance dataset** from **Kaggle** — applying one-sample and two-sample Z-tests to draw insights from real data. 🔍

The more I learn, the more it feels like solving a puzzle 🧩 — concepts that once seemed complex are now falling into place.

🔜 **Next up: T-tests!**
